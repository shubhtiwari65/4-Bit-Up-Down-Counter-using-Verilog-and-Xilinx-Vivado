# 4-Bit-Up-Down-Counter-using-Verilog-and-Xilinx-Vivado
This project implements a 4-bit up/down counter in Verilog, designed for FPGA simulation and synthesis using Xilinx Vivado. The counter increments or decrements based on a control signal and includes an asynchronous reset. A testbench is provided for functional verification.
