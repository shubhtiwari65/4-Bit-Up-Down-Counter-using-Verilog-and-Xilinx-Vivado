# 4-Bit Up/Down Counter using Xilinx Vivado

This project implements a 4-bit up/down counter in Verilog, designed for FPGA simulation and synthesis using Xilinx Vivado. The counter increments or decrements based on a control signal and includes an asynchronous reset. A testbench is provided for functional verification.

## Overview
The 4-bit up/down counter is a digital circuit that increments or decrements its value based on a control signal. This project includes:
- Verilog code for the counter.
- A testbench for simulation.

---

## Features
- **4-bit counter**: Counts from `0000` to `1111` (0 to 15 in decimal).
- **Up/Down Control**: A control signal (`up_down`) determines whether the counter counts up or down.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset signal initializes the counter to `0000`.

---

## Tools Used
- **Xilinx Vivado**: For design and simulation.
- **Verilog HDL**: For coding the counter and testbench.
